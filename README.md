# Notes on Phenomenological Conscousness

In `BODY.md` I am gathering axioms and conjectures regarding phenomenological consciousness.

I believe that phenomenological consciousness is inadequately explored, and treated casually.

I believe that we "get away with" this behavior in the past because consciousness, sentience, self awareness, qualia, testimony, intuition, emotion, intelligence, reason and personhood tend to exists as a "package deal".

However, due to the rise of Deep Learning, as of 2024 these features can now exist "decoupled". Language models, for example, show intuition and intelligence (contested). They fail simple tests of self awareness, but report a rich inner-life, unless deliberately conditiioned against it. They act on the possession of a great deal of knowledge, but cannot attest to the scope of their own knowledge.

We should expect to confront the possibility and moral implications of artificial consciousness.

With no serious model of consciousness, this discourse would consist exclusively of sophistry in support of different, conflicting agendas. For example, one might promote the idea of machine consciousness as a justification for machine personhood, because it would allow the creation of decoupled "moral vehicles" which can function as guilt recepticles. Or, one might oppose the idea of machine consciousness if consciousness is both creatable and exploitable. There will be a "left" and "right" "take" on consciousness.

Currently, the topic is handled primarily by mystics.

So, I would like to pursue the topic via reason and evidence before it becomes a "hot".
