# Notes on Phenomenological Conscousness

In `BODY.md` I am gathering axioms and conjectures regarding phenomenological consciousness. I'm interested in claims, postulates and conjectures which are either evidence-backed, or cleanly justifiable from non-controversial facts.

My thesis statement is that while phenomenological consciousness may seem "undiscussable", _admitting_ it for discussion admits necessarily a number of secondary claims.

For example, if a body can credibly testify to the existence of phenomenological consciousness, then there is a bidirectional causal relationship between the physical body and the alleged consciousness. Conversely, if a body cannot credibly testify to the existence of phenomenological consciousness, then concept has _no_ justification and can be abandoned entirely. Therefore, all discussion of the nature of consciousness presumes a bidirectional causal relationship.

I am interested exclusively in the "hard problem," but suspect one can "corner" the hard problem by working up to the boundary.

I've opened the repo with my initial thoughts in `BODY.md`, and will continue by finding, reading and digesting literature into this work.
