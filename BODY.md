Notes regarding phenomenological consciousness ("PC").

1. PC exists according to witness testimoney.

1.1. No other form of evidence suggests or attests to PC.

1.2. The primary challenge against PC is the veracity of this witness testimony.

1.3. That which is phenomenological conscioussness is that which is suggested by this witniss testimoney, and not another thing.

1.4. Therefore, consideration of PC implicitly admits this witness testimony.

2. Whereas testimony is performed via the body, in order for witness testimony to be valid, PC must affect the body.

2.1. If the body is not affected by PC, then testimonial of PC is coincidental to its existence.

2.2. If testimonial of PC is coincidental to its existence, then there is no credible testimony.

2.3. If there is no credible testimony, and no other evidence is provided, than PC can be dismissed at once.

2.4. Therefore, consideration of PC implicitly admits the affect of PC upon the body.

3. PC is an object of the body.

3.1. PC is described as encompassing qualia received via the body.

3.2. PC is described as present when the body is able to support it.

3.3. PCs are described as bounded according to the brain; a stimuli must reach a brain in order to be reported as featured in PC.

3.4. Therefore, acceptance of PC as described is acceptance of the affect of the body upon the PC.

4. Whereas the body affects the PC, and the PC affects the body, their relationship is bidirectional.

5. Whereas loss of bodily capacity entails a loss of PC, it is implied that sustenance of PC is a consequence of a special effort by the body.

5.1. Whereas typical bodies report PC, typical bodies are capable of performing this special effort.

5.2. Whereas special efforts incur a cost, its pervasiveness implies a strong selective pressure in favor of this capacity.

5.3. A strong selective pressure implies a strong benefit.

6. Achievement of PC as a result of selective pressure implies an interface that is "discoverable".

7. Achievement and exploitation of PC by biological systems implies an interface that is operable in the conditions of the body.
